  <p><u>Quantum Lib </u>
    <br>
    May '21 - Present. I developed a linear algebra library in Coq that is currently being used by QWIRE and SQIR, two quantum programming languages. I added many proofs involving eigenvectors, invertibility, and other matrix properties. I am currently working on proving the fundamental theorem of algebra. The project can be found at <a href = "https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib"> https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib</a>.

  <p><u>Gottesman Type System </u>
    <br>
    Oct '20 - Present. In <a href = "https://www.cs.umd.edu/~rrand/gottesman_types_draft.pdf"> “Gottesman Types for Quantum Programs”</a>, Rand et al. introduces a type system, based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem for characterizing quantum circuits that use the Clifford gate set.  While this system is implemented in the Coq proof assistant (allowing easy typechecking),  it is not verified using that tool. This work aims to patch these holes by directly providing a semantics for Gottesman types in Coq, and proving the necessary theorems from Gottesman and Rand et al. In the process, we allow further extensions to the type system, provided that those extensions are consistent with our semantics.  This allows us to verify typing rules that go beyond the limited expressivity of our current rules and the limitations of the Clifford gate set. The project can be found at <a href = "https://github.com/inQWIRE/Heisenberg-Foundations"> https://github.com/inQWIRE/Heisenberg-Foundations</a>. I also submitted a poster to 2021 Quantum Physics and Logic conference. The poster can be found <a href="projects\Gottesman_Semantics_poster.pdf">here</a>.

  <p><u>2020 Math REU </u>
    <br>
    Jun '20 - Sep '20. I spent the summer reading about elliptic curves and complex multiplication. My final paper can be found at <a href = "http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2020/REUPapers/Zweifler.pdf"> http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2020/REUPapers/Zweifler.pdf</a>.
